This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the login page by modifying `app/login.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file. Next you can edit each of the individual pages. Go to the page.tsx file under createNewTree, myTrees, and welcome to edit each individual page. globals.css and home.css contain the styling. firebase.ts connects to the firebase database. 

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
