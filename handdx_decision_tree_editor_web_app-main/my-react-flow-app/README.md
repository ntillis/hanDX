# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Reactflow
This app is work-in-progress. It is built on React using ReactFlow to display the data as nodes. We recommend you familiarize yourself with ReactFlow. See https://reactflow.dev/ for tutorials.

The handoff document should explain how the code functions.
